Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language that is designed to be easy to read, easy to write, and powerful.

Simple Definition

Python is a programming language used to tell a computer what to do, using clear and human-readable instructions.

Key Characteristics of Python

High-level
You don’t need to manage memory or hardware details.
It focuses on logic rather than machine-level operations.

Interpreted
Python code is executed line by line.
There is no need for compilation before running the program.

Simple and Readable Syntax
Python syntax looks close to the English language.
Example:
print("Hello, World!")

Dynamically Typed
There is no need to declare variable types explicitly.
x = 10
y = "Python"

Object-Oriented and Multi-paradigm
Python supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming.

Large Standard Library
Python comes with built-in modules for file handling, math, dates, networking, and system operations.

Platform Independent
The same Python code works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

What Python Is Used For

Python is used in web development, data science and analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, automation and scripting, cloud and DevOps, game development, and desktop applications.
